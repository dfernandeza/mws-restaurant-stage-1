#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Foodle_

## Project: Stage 1

### How to run the project

1. Go to project folder and run `npm install`

2. Then, also in this folder, start up a simple HTTP server, Python is a good option: 

- If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) 
- For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. 

_If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software._

*Image resizing optimization script*

I've included a npm script to resize and optimize project images you can run this script with:

`npm run build-images`
